    "# Detecting Payment Card Fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll look at a credit card fraud detection dataset, and build a binary classification model that can identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on provided, *historical* data. In a [2016 study](https://nilsonreport.com/upload/content_promo/The_Nilson_Report_10-17-2016.pdf), it was estimated that credit card fraud was responsible for over 20 billion dollars in loss, worldwide. Accurately detecting cases of fraud is an ongoing area of research.\n",

    "<img src=notebook_ims/fraud_detection.png width=50% />\n",
    "\n",
    "### Labeled Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment fraud data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data). This has features and labels for thousands of credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or valid. In this notebook, we'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have true labels to aim for, we'll take a **supervised learning** approach and train a binary classifier to sort data into one of our two transaction classes: fraudulent or valid.  We'll train a model on training data and see how well it generalizes on some test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will be broken down into a few steps:\n",
    "* Loading and exploring the data\n",
    "* Splitting the data into train/test sets\n",
    "* Defining and training a LinearLearner, binary classifier\n",
    "* Making improvements on the model\n",
    "* Evaluating and comparing model test performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of this notebook will focus on making improvements, as discussed in [this SageMaker blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/train-faster-more-flexible-models-with-amazon-sagemaker-linear-learner/). Specifically, we'll address techniques for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tuning a model's hyperparameters** and aiming for a specific metric, such as high recall or precision.\n",
    "2. **Managing class imbalance**, which is when we have many more training examples in one class than another (in this case, many more valid transactions than fraudulent).\n",
